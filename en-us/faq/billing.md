# FAQ - Billing

These are the most frequently asked questions for Billing. In case you still have questions, feel free to contact us through chat, social media or email.

## 1. What are "Page Extracts"? (50, 6500, 15000, ...)

Our tool will "scrape" (also known as: "extract") data from webpages. This extraction works roughly like this:

1. We load the website
2. We wait for the content to load
3. We extract the content
4. We either do:
  1. Single page
  2. Multiple pages (pagination)
  3. Infinite Scroll (keep on scrolling until limit is reached)

We charge 1 page extract per page or per full page scroll we do. When we map this to step 4, we can see:
1. Single Page == 1 Page Extract
2. Multiple Pages == X Page Extracts (depending on the pages)
3. Infinite Scroll == X Full Page Scrolls

Since we know that step 2 and 3 might become quite high, limits are put in place that you can control to define how many pages you can extract at a given moment.

## 2. What is "Price per Page outside bundle"?

We include a certain amount of page extracts in a bundle. When you go above this limit, we charge you per unit extra consumed.

Example: a bundle includes 6500 extracts and you consume 6505, then we will bill you:
* Your monthly fee for 6500 extracts
* 5 extra units consumed at the price written (e.g. 0.005$ * 5 = 0.025$)

## 3. Can I cancel my subscription anytime?

You are allowed to cancel your subscription when you wish to do so. For this you can visit the [Dashboard](https://scraper.ai/dashboard/profile/billing) under Profile -> Billing and click on "Cancel Subscription".

The subscription will now cancel and expire at the end of the renewal period automatically!

Example: you start a subscription on the 3th of august and cancel immediately, then you will have access until the 3th of September.

> Note: we do charge extra in case you go above your extract limit as defined in point 2.
